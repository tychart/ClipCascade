"""Runtime UI font resolution.

Tk does not fail when a requested font family is missing: it silently
substitutes its built-in bitmap "fixed" font, which ignores the requested size
and renders at 5 points. The GUI used to hardcode "Helvetica"/"Arial", so on
systems without those families - most notably Linux Tk builds compiled without
Xft, where fontconfig is not available to alias them to an installed font -
every label, entry, tooltip and dialog ended up in that tiny bitmap font.

``ui_font()`` returns a font in the first family from
``SANS_SERIF_CANDIDATES`` that really loads, and logs the substitution instead
of hiding it.
